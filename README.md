# Hi, I'm Satkar Karki

My name is Satkar Karki, and Iâ€™m a graduate student at the University of South Dakota with a focus on business analytics. Iâ€™m interested in data analysis, forecasting, and building tools that help people make better decisions.

- Iâ€™m setting up the **USD Business Analytics Club** to give students a place to work on real data problems, learn from each other, and build project experience.

- I recently built a dashboard that explores **referee travel and workload patterns** in NCAA Division I Menâ€™s Basketball.  
  ðŸ‘‰ [View the dashboard](https://satkar605.shinyapps.io/ncaa-dashboard/)

- Iâ€™m always open to collaboration on data projects that solve business problems.
