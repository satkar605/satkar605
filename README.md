## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi there, I'm Satkar Karki

I'm a graduate student at the University of South Dakota, where I focus on business analytics with a strong interest in combining technical precision with strategic thinking. My work spans predictive modeling, data storytelling, and operational optimization.

- 🎯 Currently building the **USD Business Analytics Club**, an initiative to help students sharpen their real-world data skills, collaborate on cross-functional projects, and gain hands-on experience in solving business problems through analytics.

- 🏀 Just launched an interactive dashboard that visualizes **referee travel patterns and workload** in NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball. This project started with scraping 6,000+ games from a legacy NCAA site and evolved into a full data product.  
  👉 [Check out the dashboard here](https://satkar605.shinyapps.io/ncaa-dashboard/)

- 🤝 Looking to **collaborate on applied analytics problems** that improve decision-making and drive operational outcomes. If you have a business challenge and want to explore a data-driven solution, let’s talk.
